# Canadian-Medicinal-Plant-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-Transfer-Learning
Nowadays, computerized plant species classification systems are used to help the people in the detection of the various species. However, the automated analysis of plant species is challenging as compared to human interpretation. This research as been provided in this field for the better classification of plant species. Even now, these methodologies lack an exact classification of the plant species. The challenge is due to the inappropriate classification algorithm. In Particular, when we consider the medicinal plant species recognition, the accuracy will be the main criteria. In this research, the suggested system implements the deep learning technique to obtain high accuracy in the classification process using computer prediction methods.The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed beside transfer learning for deep learning of medicinal plant images. This research work has been carried out on the flower images dataset of four Canadian medical plants; namely, Clubmoss, Dandelion, Lobelia, and Bloodroot, which is fed as the training dataset for the CNN and machine learning-based proposed system. Finally, an accuracy of 96% has been achieved in classification of the medicinal plant species.
